Part 1. Business Insights

## Conclusion 

The report is based on an analysis of Buttigieg's Iowa Caucus speech and Trump's speech using Text analytics technique.Based on the Iowa Caucus rise, if Buttigieg  is chosen as the Democratic presidential candidate, there are three things to focus on in a series of primaries and debates with Trump:First, we should focus more on the brevity and substance of the words we use in our speeches.Second, it is important to exclude overlaps in Trump and the use of the term, and to select and reiterate important key words.Third, if there is an expression related to the performance emphasized by Trump in the word bundle, it should be prepared to strike back on objective grounds.

## Background

Interest in former Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg , 38, is rising in the Iowa caucuses, where he will pick the Democratic presidential candidate. Buttigieg  stood out in the Democratic race because of his calm, logical rhetoric and young, fresh image. Also, he didn’t end up in the "buddy" storm but rose to the top of the race because of his moves reminiscent of former President Barack Obama. Compared to relatively radical candidates such as Warren and Sanders, the Democratic Party supporters are rather considered moderate and moderate. Unlike Buttigieg g, he is a 38-year-old young candidate. Therefore, Buttigieg  is the best choice for centrist supporters who want a generational shift.
Speech, such as TV debates and campaigning, is the most important item among the fast-rising Buttigieg ’s winning ways to compete with President Trump. Therefore, we compared the speeches of the two and analyzed the strategies that Buttigieg  should take in the discussions and speeches.

## Text Sources

I used a script for President Trump's recent speech by Buttigieg . For Trump, the State of the Union Speech and the Iowa Speech transcript were used for 2020 State of the Union Speech and Buttigieg . Based on the data in this analysis 1) Token frequency histograms 2) Corelograms 3) Bigram were analyzed to find the words, meanings and points of the Trump presidency (the "Trump") that Buttigieg  should strategically target in the TV debate.
Words frequency analysis 
The term Trump uses is ‘United’, ‘People’, ‘administration’, ‘America’ and ‘world’. On the other hand, in the case of Buttigieg , words such as ‘People’, ‘Day’, ‘Present’, ‘Value’, ‘Wait’ and ‘Ready’ were frequently used. Buttigieg  needs to reduce the use of abstract words such as ‘President’ and ‘Value’ in future speech strategies.
